A multilevel model for analyzing tree ring data from Arbellay et al 2017.  

This repository includes a multilevel modeling analysis of four types of data used to measure tree growth.  
Details of the data are in a paper by Asbellay et al (2017) submitted to the journal Tree Physiology.  
As the journal's statistics editor, I am responsible for the quality of statistical analysis in accepted papers. For
this paper, I requested that the authors allow me to reanalyze their data using what I believe is the most appropriate method.

This repository includes:
1. R-markdown file of the model code
2. Data
