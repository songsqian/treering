A multilevel model for analyzing tree ring data from Arbellay et al 2017.  

This repository includes a multilevel modeling analysis of four types of data used to measure tree growth.  
Details of the data are in a paper by Asbellay et al (2018) (Tree Physiology, accepted).  

As the journal's statistics editor, I am responsible for evaluating the quality of statistical analysis in selected manuscripts. For
this paper, I requested that the authors allow me to reanalyze their data using what I believe is the most appropriate method.

This repository includes:
1. R-markdown file of the model code
2. Data
